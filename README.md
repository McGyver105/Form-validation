## Form validation exercies

Contained in this repo is a quick exercise we did regarding the HTML Document Object Model (DOM).

It contains a simple outer page which requires a username, first name, last name, and your date of birth. Requirements for these details are written clearly above the input boxes.

Successful completion of these inputs allows you entry to the inner bonus page. But if an input is invalid, you'll get a colour change and an error message informing you of a problem.
